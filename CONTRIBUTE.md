# Contributing to Event Attendance

Thank you for your interest in contributing to **Event Attendance**! We welcome and appreciate contributions from the community. By following the guidelines below, you'll help make the project better for everyone.

## How to Contribute

### 1. Fork the Repository

Start by forking the repository on GitHub. This will create a copy of the repository under your GitHub account where you can make changes without affecting the main project.

- Go to the [Event Attendance GitHub Repository](https://github.com/yourusername/event-attendance).
- Click the **Fork** button at the top-right corner of the page.

### 2. Create a New Branch

Before making any changes, create a new branch for your feature or bug fix. This helps keep the main branch clean and ensures that your changes can be reviewed properly.

```bash
git checkout -b feature/your-feature-name
```

### 3. Make Your Changes

Work on your changes locally in your new branch. Be sure to follow the coding style and structure used throughout the project.

- If you’re adding a feature, make sure to update relevant files like the UI, backend, or database schema.
- If you’re fixing a bug, ensure that the bug is thoroughly tested.

### 4. Write Tests

If applicable, write unit tests or integration tests to ensure that your changes work as expected. Tests help maintain the stability and reliability of the project.

### 5. Commit Your Changes

Once you’ve made your changes, commit them to your branch with a clear and concise message explaining what was changed.

```bash
git add .
git commit -m "Add feature: brief description"
```

### 6. Push Your Changes

After committing your changes, push them to your forked repository on GitHub.

```bash
git push origin feature/your-feature-name
```

### 7. Open a Pull Request

Now that your changes are pushed to GitHub, open a pull request (PR) to the `main` branch of the original repository. Describe your changes in the PR, and explain why they should be merged.

- Go to your forked repository.
- Click on the **Pull Request** tab.
- Click **New Pull Request**, select your branch, and provide a detailed description of your changes.

### 8. Review and Feedback

Once the pull request is submitted, the project maintainers will review it. You might be asked to make adjustments before it is merged.

- Respond to any comments or requests for changes.
- Keep the pull request up to date if necessary (for example, if there are new changes to the `main` branch).

### 9. Celebrate!

Once your pull request is merged, celebrate your contribution! You’ve made the project better for everyone.
